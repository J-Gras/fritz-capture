# FRITZ Capture ðŸª¤

This is a Python script to obtain packet captures from FRITZ!Boxes.

```
usage: fritz_capture.py [-h] [-f URL] [-u USER] [-p PASSWORD] [-o FILE] [-i INTERFACE] [--check-cert] [--debug]

This script obtains a packet capture from a given FRITZ!Box.

options:
  -h, --help    show this help message and exit
  -f URL        URL of the FRITZ!Box [https://fritz.box]
  -u USER       username to login with [last user logged in]
  -p PASSWORD   password to login with
  -o FILE       output file [stdout]
  -i INTERFACE  interface to capture [1-lan]
  --check-cert  enable certificate check (disabled by default due to self-signed FRITZ!Box certificates)
  --debug       enable debug mode
```

The session handling is based on the example code provided by [AVM](https://avm.de/service/schnittstellen/).

## Usage Examples

The most basic approach is to write to a file using `-o`:
```
# ./fritz_capture.py -o example.pcap
```
This will use the default FRITZ!Box user (i.e. the last user logged in), prompt for the password and write to `example.pcap`. To stop capturing send SIGINT (Ctrl + C).

To view the packet stream live, the packet stream can be piped into tcpdump:
```
# ./fritz_capture.py | tcpdump -r -
```
The same works with Wireshark as well:
```
# ./fritz_capture.py | wireshark -k -i -
```
Using `-i -` Wireshark reads from standard input, with `-k` instructing it to start immediately.

**NOTE:** While the available interfaces differ depending on the FRITZ!Box model, `lan-1` seems to be a reasonable default. If you do not see the expected traffic, consider to chose another interface.

## Background

FRITZ!Boxes allow to obtain packet captures of various interfaces via (https://fritz.box/html/capture.html). There are already several scripts and code snippets available to use this capture interface. However, unable to find a small tool that supports the updated login mechanism introduced in FRITZ!OS 7.24 and uses HTTPS, this script was created.

The script has been tested to work with the following FRITZ!Box models:
* FRITZ!Box 3390
* FRITZ!Box 7490
* FRITZ!Box 7530

Furthermore, it has been tested to work with FRITZ!OS versions between 06.55 and 7.29.
